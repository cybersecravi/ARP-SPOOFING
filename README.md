# ARP-SPOOFING
In my latest project, I developed a Python program to simulate a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack for educational and research purposes in a secure lab environment. This project explores the risks associated with ARP spoofing and underscores the importance of robust network security practices.
1Ô∏è‚É£ Step 1: I developed a script to scan the network and retrieve the MAC addresses of devices in the subnet.
2Ô∏è‚É£ Step 2: Using ARP spoofing, the victim device is tricked into thinking I am the router, while the router sees me as the victim.
3Ô∏è‚É£ Step 3: This establishes me as the intermediary, allowing observation of all communications between the target and the internet.

üîé The project highlights the importance of network security, exposing vulnerabilities that attackers can exploit. By understanding these techniques, we can develop stronger defenses like ARP inspection and anomaly detection.
